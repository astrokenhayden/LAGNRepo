On the Elder Plain a great city stands aloof from the turmoultuous land. 
Naridge exists apart from the world.
Those who would seek entry must overcome four great trials.
From tumbling mind games, to a mix of X's and O's, to paddles and balls, and to the end of chance.
These trials are not undertaken lightly. 
For those willing and able however; the glory and riches that come from gaining entry last many lifetimes.
