On the Elder Plain a great city stands aloof from the turmoultuous land. 
Naridge exists apart from the world.
Those who would seek entry must overcome four great trials.
From Bandits on the Road, to the Falingual River, Goblins in the Calin Mountains, and the Cenote Desert.
These trials are not undertaken lightly. 
For those willing and able however; the glory and riches that come from gaining entry last many lifetimes.
